All code used in this project is open source under some OS license. If I've misused a license or any authors feel 
that I've somehow violated their rights, just drop me e-mail and I will do my best to make it right both legally and 
morally. bookworm.productions@gmail.com

In regards to the licensing and copyright of this project
---------------------------------------------------------
It is not my concern to keep control over code that I want everyone to have freedom to use as they wish. My 
copyright headers are there for license compatibility and out of respect to OSM wishes that Joomla! template code be 
GPL, but personally I could care less what you do with my code. If you so desire, you may print it out and then use 
the paper to beat baby seals * although thats not suggested.

If you do something in violation of the GPL all I ask is that you don't pretend my work is yours. The golden rule "don't steal" is all that I ask of you.                            

I'm not going to chase down license violators, its not something I care about. I just want my work to be made 
available to as many as possible. Whether its made available through GPL2, GPL3, BSD, MIT or something else I don't 
really care. If you want to take and license my work under another Open Source license do so without fear of me. 

* Not only does this harm the beater psychologically(ever seen a baby seal cry? trust me its heart wrenching) but it 
also results in detrimental damage to both the environment and the seal population. Plus seals have enough god damn 
problems don't be a jerk and create more for them. 

:::: Code Credits 

CodeIgniter
-----------    
This framework is significantly inspired by the design patterns used in the CodeIgniter framework. Without it this 
framework would have been significantly messier. Thanks allot guys your code taught me allot about PHP design 
patterns. 

Several of the framework helpers(specifically form, file and html) have large if not entire portions of code 
borrowed from codeIgniter helpers.

:::: The Inspiring Ideas and People.
                   
Many of the concepts and ideas in this framework are heavily influenced by peers in the Joomla! world, the 
Wordpress world and beyond. I'd like to briefly mention and thank them below.          

Forest Linden, Barry North, the JoomlaShack guys, and my clients; for originally inspiring me to think about what a 
Joomla! site creator needs are. Joomla! developers need to keep the site tweaker in mind, the guy who knows a little 
bit of CSS, PHP, and XHTML but cant make complex modifications. I hope they helped me find a good balance between 
the needs of the advanced developer and the average techie guy.

JoomlaBamboo for their Zen Grid and Brian Teeman for his philosophizing on what a Joomla! template should be.  
http://brian.teeman.net/joomla-gps/the-best-joomla-template.html     

Anthony Short, Shaun Inman, and Nathan Smith for their work and writings on CSS frameworks.  

Anonymous WP guy in RocketTheme chat room who got me thinking about how to do Hooks in Joomla!. I don't remember 
your nick but Thanks man!     

The crew at JoomlaXTC for being very patient with development delays and for helping to promote themeMagic.
                                                              
Prothemer and their Morph framework for inspiring me to re-think what a Joomla! template should and could be.    

RocketTheme for showing with their Gantry framework what a Joomla! admin panel could truly be.

Adii for his woocamp blog posts on frameworks.

Woothemes crew for their inspiring designs and wonderfully simple framework. 

Ian Stewart for his educational blog posts. 

And finally a big shout out and copyright credit to The Joomla! dev team for providing a powerful platform to build 
this template framework on. Thanks a million! If only I could give them an actual million :)
